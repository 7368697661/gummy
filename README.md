THEME DEVELOPMENT STATUS: IN PROGRESS 🚧

Hello there! I'm in the process of creating Gummy, a theme for Obsidian that's designed to refine and enhance the recent design changes Obsidian has undergone. Inspired by the sleek new logo and the crisp Obsidian homepage, Gummy aims to bring a modern, app-like feel to your note-taking experience.

Gummy is not just a theme; it's a celebration of Obsidian's evolution. It's built upon the stunning 1.0 redesign of Obsidian, introducing changes to create a sleek, modern interface that aligns with the new visual direction of Obsidian.

🎨 Color Schemes

While Gummy doesn't offer Style Settings or color schemes, the ambiant gradient and multiple ui elements respond dynanamically to your chosen accent color.

📝 Typography

I've carefully selected typefaces that complement Obsidian's new design language. The default title typeface is [Peace Sans](https://www.behance.net/gallery/34760019/Peace-Sans-FREE-FONT?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended|free%20font), the body font is [Space Grotesk](https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk) and UI typeface is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), and the monospace typeface is [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).
